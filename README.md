# FXgl
A (Attempt at a) OpenGL-styled framework for rendering with the SuperFX GSU for the SNES with a C API (For use with DevKitSnes/pvsneslib)
## How to compile
First, install [pvsneslib](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib), then inside the bin folder of devkitsnes (inside the pvsneslib root folder), install WLA-SuperFX from [here](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx/releases).

Then just run ``make`` within the root directory, else go into ``/superFX`` and run make there.
## Issues
It doesn't run on bsnes-plus/accurate, nor snes9x, which will be (and is) a issue.
